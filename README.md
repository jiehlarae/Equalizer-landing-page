## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I did the challenge twice because of a responsiveness issue. In my second attempt, I tried a mobile-first workflow before progressing to larger sizes, as I found this approach more intuitive.


### Continued development

I faced challenges when positioning the patterns, working to ensure they seamlessly integrated with the surrounding elements without causing any spacing issues. But I found the use of ::before pseudo-element, providing a solution to strategically place the patterns without disrupting the layout of other components. I would like to explore it more and get the hang of it.
